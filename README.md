KantanDocGen Plugin
-------------

Adds an option to the editor main menu, which brings up a dialog for specifying which modules/packages/classes to document.
Documentation is generated from tooltips/C++ comments.

Plugin relies on KantanDocGenTool for converting intermediate xml form into html. This is packaged inside the plugin, but the source is also available (see KantanDocGenTool repo).
